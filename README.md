# Xenforo 2.0 widget pulling html from remote cms.

This is a simple widget made for Xenforo 2.0. It pulls content from remote url and inserts it as it is. If cache is enabled it is being cached for X number of minutes.

Nothing fancy here but if you need a good starting point to create your own widget - here you go.
