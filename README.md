# Xenforo 2.0 widget pulling html from remote cms.

This is a simple widget made for Xenforo 2.0. It pulls content from remote url, caches it and inserts it as is. If cache is disabled it does nothing.

Nothing fancy here but if you need a good starting point to create your own widget - here you go.
